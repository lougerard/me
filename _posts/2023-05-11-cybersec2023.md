ASSYST EUROPE was an exhibitor at the <a href="https://www.cyberseceurope.com/" target="_blank">Cybersec Europe</a> 2023 event in Brussels, Belgium.
We promoted our services in the cybersecurity field including the XDR product from our partner TEHTRIS.

We also showecased 2 real attacks as we can find in a Red Team engagement.

During the 2 days of the event, I also visited stands from other security actors like Rapid7, SANS, Eset, Cloudflare, CrowdStrike, etc.
