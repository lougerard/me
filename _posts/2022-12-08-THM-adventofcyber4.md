_naughty-list_

The 18 of november 2022 was a friday !

Answer : Friday

### What is the IP address of the attacker?
From the previous search, we got the IP requesting the naughty list : 10.10.249.191

Answer : 10.10.249.191

### What is the name of the important list that the attacker stole from Santa?
We can search for all 'HTTP/1.1" 200' in our log file :

![santaslist.txt](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_12.png)
_santaslist.txt_

Answer : santaslist.txt

### Look through the log files for the flag. The format of the flag is: THM{}

## TASK 8 : [Day 3] OSINT Nothing escapes detective McRed
### What is the name of the Registrar for the domain santagift.shop? 

We can find the registrar of a domain with multiple tools as online DomainTools <https://whois.domaintools.com/> :

![DomainTools](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_14.png)
_DomainTools_

We can submit our domain name and after checking the "we are not a robot" box, we have the following result :

![Namecheap Inc](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_15.png)
_Namecheap Inc_

Answer : Namecheap Inc

### Find the website's source code (repository) on github.com and open the file containing sensitive credentials. Can you find the flag?

A quick googling search leads us to muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop repository and especially the config.php file : 

![SantaGiftShop](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_16.png)
_SantaGiftShop_

We can find the flag directly by inspecting the file :

![SantaGiftShop Github](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_17.png)
_SantaGiftShop Github_

Or by requesting the content of the file with some tools like curl with the raw url of our file :

```console
C:\Users\User>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop/main/config.php
<?php
$FLAG = '{THM_OSINT_WORKS}';
/**
 * If you have arrived here, the flag value is {THM_OSINT_WORKS}
 *
 * The wp-config.php creation script uses this file during the installation.
 * You don't have to use the web site, you can copy this file to "wp-config.php"
 * and fill in the values.
 *
 * This file contains the following configurations:
 *
 * * Database settings
 * * Secret keys
 * * Database table prefix
 * * ABSPATH
 *
 *
 */

$ENV = "PROD"; //santagift.shop - Incase of QA, it will be qa.santagift.shop
[...]
```
{: .nolineno }

Answer : {THM_OSINT_WORKS}

### What is the name of the file containing passwords?
From our previous research : config.php

Answer : config.php

### What is the name of the QA server associated with the website?

We can pipe our curl command with the findstr (on windows) or grep (on linux) to find the keyword we are looking for :

```console
C:\Users\User>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop/main/config.php | findstr "QA"
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  3512  100  3512    0     0  86088      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 87800
$ENV = "PROD"; //santagift.shop - Incase of QA, it will be qa.santagift.shop
if($ENV = "QA"){...}
```
{: .nolineno }

Answer : qa.santagift.shop

### What is the DB_PASSWORD that is being reused between the QA and PROD environments?

In the same way, we can retreive the password :

```console
C:\Users\User>curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muhammadthm/SantaGiftShop/main/config.php | findstr "DB_PASS"
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  3512  100  3512    0     0  15495      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 15608
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'S@nta2022' );

### What is the name of the service running on port 22 on the QA server?

Running a nmap scan on port 22 :

```console

### What flag can you find after successfully accessing the Samba service?

We can list the smb shares with "smbclient" :

```console
root@ip-10-10-116-95:~# smbclient -L 10.10.11.116
WARNING: The "syslog" option is deprecated
Enter WORKGROUP\root's password:

	WORKGROUP            IP-10-10-11-116
```
{: .nolineno }

We assume we got previously a compromised username (ubuntu) and password (S@nta2022) so we can connect to the shares :

```console
root@ip-10-10-116-95:~# smbclient -U ubuntu //10.10.11.116/admins
WARNING: The "syslog" option is deprecated
Enter WORKGROUP\ubuntu's password:

```
{: .nolineno }

We can now download the 2 files present on the admins share and retreive the flag :

```console


smb: \> get flag.txt 
getting file \flag.txt of size 23 as flag.txt (7.5 KiloBytes/sec) (average 7.5 KiloBytes/sec)
smb: \> get userlist.txt

## TASK 15 : [Day 10] Hack a game You're a mean one, Mr. Yeti 

### What is the Guard's flag?

This task is a game break challenge with all needed materials in the provided machine to deploy.

When we run the "save Mc Skiddy" shorcut on the Desktop, it launch a web-browser game. We can open the Cetus addin from the developper tools :

![developper tools](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_39.png)
_developper tools_

Then let's take a look at the game :

![Game](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_40.png)
_Game_

We can speak to a guard at the right of the screen. After some dialogues, he will makes us a deal to escape the prison :

![Guard](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_41.png)
_Guard_

As we don't now the answer, let's try something random :

![Guard Challenge Random](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_42.png)
_Guard Challenge Random_

And it's oviously not the correct answer :

![Guard Challenge Answer](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_43.png)
_Guard Challenge Answer_

But now we have the exact value of the number, we can use CETUS to determine the memory address of the stored "needed number" :

![Guard Challenge address](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_44.png)
_Guard Challenge address_

If we convert this hex value to decimal, it is our requested number : 

![Guard Challenge address translated](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_45.png)
_Guard Challenge address translated_

Now we control the memory address with the answer, we can play again the problem asked by the guard and just read the requested number before answering the guard. For this, let's save as bookmark the memory address and switch to bookmarks tab :

![Bookmarks](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_46.png)
_Bookmarks_

Now let's ask the guard again for the number :

![Guard Challenge](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_47.png)
_Guard Challenge_

Before answering, we can convert the new value stored at the memory address saved :

![Guard Challenge Correct Answer](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_48.png)
_Guard Challenge Correct Answer_

We can enter this value and hit "enter" :

![Guard Challenge solved](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_49.png)
_Guard Challenge solved_

![Guard Challenge solved 2](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_50.png)
_Guard Challenge solved 2_

When the dialogue end, we can speak to the guard again to have his flag :

![Guard Challenge Flag](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_51.png)

### What is the Yeti's flag?

Let's move on the bridge, now that the door is open :

![Cannon Challenge](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_52.png)
_Cannon Challenge_

We can try to pass the cannon snowball (1) but it seems to affect our health point (2) :

![Cannon Challenge try](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_53.png)
_Cannon Challenge try_

So we need to find a way to get around this part. Passing through all canon snowballs his next to impossible !

Let's try to determine the health point memory address. Honnestly, i get it first try, but you may required some reflection to get this one. I started with the idea that health point may be something like 100 (for 100% or traditionaly 100 HP). So what does CETUS gives us for 100 :

![Cannon Challenge HP](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_54.png)
_Cannon Challenge HP_

We get 31 different results. We can try to loose some hp an see which result has changed with a value "LT" (less then) 100 :

![Cannon Challenge HP Value](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_55.png)
_Cannon Challenge HP Value_

It seems we found the right memory address linked to our health point. We can bookmarked this memory address and freeze its value :

![Cannon Challenge HP Freeze](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_56.png)
_Cannon Challenge HP Freeze_

Now that we will not loose any HP, we can safely pass through all canons snowballs !

![Cannon Challenge success](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_57.png)
_Cannon Challenge success_

When we passed the bridge, we find the Bandit Yeti avatar :

![Bandit Yeti](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_58.png)
_Bandit Yeti_

The Yeti will face us with a last test but with our HP frozen it will go easily :

![Bandit Yeti Challenge](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_59.png)
_Bandit Yeti Challenge_

Reading all dialogues and you will get the bandit yeti's flag :

![Bandit Yeti Flag](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_60.png)
_Bandit Yeti Flag_

This is the end of this game break challenge !

```
{: .nolineno }

Answer : 8

### Filtering for Usernames: One username consists of a readable word concatenated with a number. What is it?

We can craft the following regEx to match any alphanumeric character set that start a word follows by a numerical set :

```console
^[a-zA-Z]+[0-9]+$
```
{: .nolineno }

![User35](/images/thm/adventofcyber4/adventofcyber4_112.png)
_User35_

As for username, we have a condition that the length must be between 6 and 12, user35 is our answer.

Answer : user35

### Filtering for Emails: How many emails fit the syntax above?
The following regEx can be crafted : 

```console
^[a-zA-Z0-9.\-]+\@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.com$
```
{: .nolineno }

It says that the first part of the email must contains alphanumeric characters (including . and -) then following by @ then again alphanumeric character set and ending by ".com"

```console
ubuntu@tryhackme:~/Desktop/RegExPractice$ egrep ^[a-zA-Z0-9.\-]+\@[a-zA-Z0-9]+\.com$ strings

## TASK 25: [Day 20] Firmware Binwalkin’ around the Christmas tree 
### What is the flag value after reversing the file firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg? Note: The flag contains underscores - if you're seeing spaces, the underscores might not be rendering.
Firstly, when we try to reversing the firmwarev2.2, we got nothing because, it is encrypted :

```console
test@ip-10-10-207-155:~$ ls
bin  bin-unsigned  firmware-mod-kit
test@ip-10-10-207-155:~$ cd bin
test@ip-10-10-207-155:~/bin$ ls
firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg
test@ip-10-10-207-155:~/bin$ binwalk -E -N firmwarev2.2-encrypted.gpg 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             Rising entropy edge (0.989903)

test@ip-10-10-207-155:~/bin$
```
{: .nolineno }

So as we have a previous version of the firmware, not encrypted, we can try to find our keys in it :

```console
Test@ip-10-10-207-155:~/bin$ cd ../bin-unsigned/
test@ip-10-10-207-155:~/bin-unsigned$ ls
firmwarev1.0-unsigned
test@ip-10-10-207-155:~/bin-unsigned$ binwalk -E -N firmwarev1.0-unsigned 

DECIMAL       HEXADECIMAL     ENTROPY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0             0x0             Falling entropy edge (0.428457)
14336         0x3800          Rising entropy edge (0.956537)

test@ip-10-10-207-155:~/bin-unsigned$ 
```
{: .nolineno }

Seems we can reverse this one ! We can use the given password for the machine (Santa1010) when prompted :

### What Mosquitto version is the device using?
From last nmap scan :

```console
PORT     STATE SERVICE                 REASON         VERSION

### What flag is obtained from viewing the RTSP stream?

Following the stesp :

  1. Nmap scan discovered port 1883 as Mosquitto : ok

  2. Nmap scan discovered device/init to obtain device ID : T8ECW2Z1I4QRGH2MQTMK

  3. Start a [RTSP](https://github.com/aler9/rtsp-simple-server) : port 8554 !

      mosquitto_pub --help

-A : bind the outgoing socket to this host/ip address. Use to control which interface
      the client communicates over.
-d : enable debug messages.
-f : send the contents of a file as the message.
-h : mqtt host to connect to. Defaults to localhost.
-i : id to use for this client. Defaults to mosquitto_pub_ appended with the process id.
-I : define the client id as id_prefix appended with the process id. Useful for when the
      broker is using the clientid_prefixes option.
-k : keep alive in seconds for this client. Defaults to 60.
-l : read messages from stdin, sending a separate message for each line.
-m : message payload to send.
-M : the maximum inflight messages for QoS 1/2..
-n : send a null (zero length) message.
-p : network port to connect to. Defaults to 1883.
-P : provide a password (requires MQTT 3.1 broker)
-q : quality of service level to use for all messages. Defaults to 0.
-r : message should be retained.
-s : read message from stdin, sending the entire input as a message.
-S : use SRV lookups to determine which host to connect to.
-t : mqtt topic to publish to.
-u : provide a username (requires MQTT 3.1 broker)
-V : specify the version of the MQTT protocol to use when connecting.
      Can be mqttv31 or mqttv311. Defaults to mqttv31.
--help : display this message.
--quiet : don't print error messages.
--will-payload : payload for the client Will, which is sent by the broker in case of
                  unexpected disconnection. If not given and will-topic is set, a zero
                  length message will be sent.
--will-qos : QoS level for the client Will.
--will-retain : if given, make the client Will retained.
--will-topic : the topic on which to publish the client Will.
--cafile : path to a file containing trusted CA certificates to enable encrypted
            communication.
--capath : path to a directory containing trusted CA certificates to enable encrypted
            communication.
--cert : client certificate for authentication, if required by server.
--key : client private key for authentication, if required by server.
--ciphers : openssl compatible list of TLS ciphers to support.
--tls-version : TLS protocol version, can be one of tlsv1.2 tlsv1.1 or tlsv1.
                Defaults to tlsv1.2 if available.
--insecure : do not check that the server certificate hostname matches the remote
              hostname. Using this option means that you cannot be sure that the
              remote host is the server you wish to connect to and so is insecure.
              Do not use this option in a production environment.
--psk : pre-shared-key in hexadecimal (no leading 0x) to enable TLS-PSK mode.
--psk-identity : client identity string for TLS-PSK mode.
--proxy : SOCKS5 proxy URL of the form:
          socks5h://[username[:password]@]hostname[:port]
          Only "none" and "username" authentication is supported.

See http://mosquitto.org/ for more information.
