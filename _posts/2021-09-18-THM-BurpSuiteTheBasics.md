It's forwarding the request to the destination.

## TASK 9 : Connecting through the Proxy (FoxyProxy) 

### Read through the options in the right-click menu. There is one particularly useful option that allows you to intercept and modify the response to your request. What is this option ? Intercept a request with burp then go to proxy intercept and take a look in the right-click menu !

No Answer

## TASK 12 : Scoping and Targeting 

### Add http://10.10.7.65/ to your scope and change the Proxy settings to only intercept traffic to in-scope targets. See the difference between the amount of traffic getting caught by the proxy before and after limiting the scope.
    
No Answer

## TASK 13 : Site Map and Issue Definitions 

### Take a look around the site on http://10.10.7.65/ -- we will be using this a lot throughout the module. Visit every page linked to from the homepage, then check your sitemap -- one endpoint should stand out as being very unusual !  Visit this in your browser (or use the "Response" section of the site map entry for that endpoint)  What is the flag you receive? 

After visiting the website, i see a special request GET /5yjR2GLcoGoij2ZK HTTP/1.1 which give us the flag in the response : THM{NmNlZTliNGE1MWU1ZTQzMzgzNmFiNWVk}  

Answer : THM{NmNlZTliNGE1MWU1ZTQzMzgzNmFiNWVk}  

### Look through the Issue Definitions list. What is the typical severity of a Vulnerable JavaScript dependency?
    
Just search about "Vulnerable JavaScript dependency" in the Issue Definitions list.  

Answer : Low  

## TASK 14 : Example Attack

### Try typing: &lt;script  alert("Succ3ssful XSS")&lt;/script  , into the "Contact Email" field. You should find that there is a client-side filter in place which prevents you from adding any special characters that aren't allowed in email addresses :
    

No Answer  

### Fortunately for us, client-side filters are absurdly easy to bypass. There are a variety of ways we could disable the script or just prevent it from loading in the first place.  Let's focus on simply bypassing the filter for now.  First, make sure that your Burp Proxy is active and that the intercept is on.
    
No Answer  

### Now, enter some legitimate data into the support form. For example: "pentester@example.thm" as an email address, and "Test Attack" as a query. Submit the form -- the request should be intercepted by the proxy.
    
No Answer  

### With the request captured in the proxy, we can now change the email field to be our very simple payload from above: &lt;script  alert("Succ3ssful XSS")&lt;/script  . After pasting in the payload, we need to select it, then URL encode it with the Ctrl + U shortcut to make it safe to send. This process is shown in the GIF below :
    
No Answer  

### Finally, press the "Forward" button to send the request.  You should find that you get an alert box from the site indicating a successful XSS attack !
    
No Answer

### Congratulations, you bypassed the filter ! Don't expect it to be quite so easy in real life, but this should hopefully give you an idea of the kind of situation in which Burp Proxy can be useful. 
    

No Answer
