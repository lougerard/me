THM Room [https://tryhackme.com/room/yara](https://tryhackme.com/room/yara)


## TASK 1 : Introduction 
### Let's get started 
No Answer

## TASK 2 : What is Yara? 
2.3. Caveat: Malware Analysis
Explaining the functionality of malware is vastly out of scope for this room due to the sheer size of the topic. I have covered strings in much more detail in "Task 12 - Strings" of my MAL: Introductory room. In fact, I am creating a whole Learning Path for it. If you'd like to get a taster whilst learning the fundamentals, I'd recommend my room.

### What is the name of the base-16 numbering system that Yara can detect? 
Answer : Hex

### Would the text "Enter your Name" be a string in an application? (Yay/Nay)
Answer : YAY

## TASK 3 : Installing Yara (Ubuntu/Debian & Windows) 
### I've installed Yara and/or are using the attached VM!
No Answer

## TASK 4 : Deploy 
### I've either connected to my instance or installed Yara on my own operating system! 
No Answer

## TASK 5 : Introduction to Yara Rules
### One rule to - well - rule them all. 
On the deploy machine and connected in SSH :

```console
cmnatic@thm-yara:~/myyara$touch somefile
cmnatic@thm-yara:~/myyara$nano myrule 
    rule examplerule {
        condition:true
    }
cmnatic@thm-yara:~/myyara$ yara myfirstrule.yar somefile 
examplerule somefile
cmnatic@thm-yara:~/myyara$ yara myfirstrule.yar somefile2 
error scanning somefile2: could not open file
```
{: .nolineno }

No Answer

## TASK 6 : Expanding on Yara Rules 
Information security researcher "fr0gger_" has recently created a handy cheatsheet that breaks down and visualises the elements of a YARA rule (shown above, all image credits go to him). It's a great reference point in getting started!

_Yara_

### Upwards and onwards... 
No Answer

## TASK 7 : Yara Modules
### Sounds pretty cool! 
No Answer

## TASK 8 : Other tools and Yara
### Cool tools. I'm ready to use one of them. 

1- LOKI
2- THOR
3- FENRIR
4- YAYA

No Answer

## TASK 9 : Using LOKI and its Yara rule set
Scenario: You are the security analyst for a mid-size law firm. A co-worker discovered suspicious files on a web server within your organization. These files were discovered while performing updates to the corporate website. The files have been copied to your machine for analysis. The files are located in the suspicious-files directory. Use Loki to answer the questions below.

### Scan file 1. Does Loki detect this file as suspicious/malicious or benign? 

```console
cmnatic@thm-yara:~/suspicious-files/file1$ python ../../tools/Loki/loki.py -p .

[...]
[RESULT] Suspicious objects detected!
[RESULT] Loki recommends a deeper analysis of the suspicious objects.
[...]
```

Answer : 20

### One of the conditions to match on the Yara rule specifies file size. The file has to be less than what amount?
Answer : 700KB

## TASK 11 : Valhalla
Picking up from our scenario, at this point, you know that the 2 files are related. Even though Loki classified the files are suspicious, you know in your gut that they are malicious. Hence the reason you created a Yara rule using yarGen to detect it on other web servers. But let's further pretend that you are not code-savvy (FYI - not all security professionals know how to code/script or read it). You need to conduct further research regarding these files to receive approval to eradicate these files from the network. 

Time to use Valhalla for some threat intelligence gathering...

### Enter the SHA256 hash of file 1 into Valhalla. Is this file attributed to an APT group? (Yay/Nay) 

![Valhalla File 1](/images/thm/yara/yara_2.png)
_Valhalla File 1_

Answer : YAY

### Do the same for file 2. What is the name of the first Yara rule to detect file 2?

![Valhalla File 2](/images/thm/yara/yara_3.png)
_Valhalla File 2_

Answer : Webshell_b374k_rule1

### Examine the information for file 2 from Virus Total (VT). The Yara Signature Match is from what scanner?

![VirusTotal File 2](/images/thm/yara/yara_4.png)
_VirusTotal File 2_

Answer : THOR APT Scanner

### Enter the SHA256 hash of file 2 into Virus Total. Did every AV detect this as malicious? (Yay/Nay)

![VirusTotal File 2 SHA256](/images/thm/yara/yara_5.png)
_VirusTotal File 2 SHA256_

No only 29 at this time.

Answer : NAY

### Besides .PHP, what other extension is recorded for this file?

![VirusTotal details](/images/thm/yara/yara_6.png)
_VirusTotal details_

Answer : exe

### Back to Valhalla, inspect the Info for this rule. Under Statistics what was the highest rule match per month in the last 2 years? (YYYY/M)

![Valhalla 2021](/images/thm/yara/yara_7.png)
_Valhalla 2021_

Answer : 2021/3

### What JavaScript library is used by file 2? 

```console
https://github.com/b374k/b374k/blob/master/index.php
[...]
/* JAVASCRIPT AND CSS FILES START */
$zepto_code = packer_read_file($GLOBALS['packer']['base_dir']."zepto.js");

else $theme ="default";
$css_code = packer_read_file($GLOBALS['packer']['theme_dir'].$theme.".css");

Answer : zepto

### Is this Yara rule in the default Yara file Loki uses to detect these type of hack tools? (Yay/Nay) 

We had to generate this rule !

Answer : NAY
